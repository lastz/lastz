=========

This repository contains the latest official working branch of LASTZ.
Official **releases** are tagged, and can be found in
https://github.com/lastz/lastz/releases.
Users are encouraged to use a tagged release, as this working branch may not
be stable.

For information about installation and use, see https://lastz.github.io/lastz
(equivalent to README.lastz.html in this repository).

Legacy releases — those prior to September 2021 — can be found at

The UCSC genome browser group has included lastz and lastz_D in their prebuilt
binaries (the version there might lag behind the latest version here):
